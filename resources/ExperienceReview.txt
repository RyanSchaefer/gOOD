The biggest lesson we learned from the code that was given to us was how to make a simpler view.
Our group struggled with programming the GUI and I think seeing a proper working implementation
was eye opening. It also goes to show that some people are better at building specific parts of a
program (view vs model). There wasn't really much interaction on either end. Looking back on how
we believe the model we were given was implemented versus how we implemented our model, we believe
that we might have put undue stress on those we provided to if they had to "upsample" from a Sexp /
String based model to our model. We don't know if that is bad on our end, but it was just something
to think about.
